This is a companion website by the DALI Lab created for author Ernest Hebert's series of novels, 'The Darby Chronicles'. Here, visitors can play with an interactive map to learn more about the world Ernest has created and peruse the novels, as well as read essays, poems, and blog posts that Ernest plans to add on a regular basis.

This project runs on the Ghost blogging platform, and more info can be found here: 'http://themes.ghost.org/''
