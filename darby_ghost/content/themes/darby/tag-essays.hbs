                Trouble with conversation is that people are always interrupting me, or I'm always interrupting them. In writing these essays on the human condition in fictional Darby my only competitor (and ally) was the contrarian voice in my head. My goal in these essays is to expand the world of fictional Darby beyond the information conveyed in the seven novels of the Darby Chronicles.
